"""owner_id -> ON DELETE SET NULL, so deleting a user is never blocked.

Revision ID: 016_owner_set_null
Revises: 015_server_rev
Create Date: 2026-08-19

`projects.owner_id` referenced `users.id` with PostgreSQL's default NO ACTION,
so removing a user failed as soon as they owned anything:

    ERROR: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint
           "projects_owner_id_fkey" on table "projects"

Four modules (pilot, surface, appsec, watch) already cascaded their user rows
while six refused the delete — same suite, two behaviours, and no way to
de-provision someone cleanly. SET NULL matches the ownership idiom already in
use everywhere (`owner_id = user.id if user else None`): a null owner is an
expected, handled state. The owned objects are kept — only the link goes.
