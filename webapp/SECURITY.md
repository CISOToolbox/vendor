# Security Policy

## Threat model in one paragraph

Vendor (TPRM) is a **100 % client-side web application**. There is no backend, no
account, no server-side storage and no telemetry. Everything you type stays in
your browser (`localStorage` for autosave and snapshots) until you explicitly
save a file to your own disk. The only outbound requests are the ones you
trigger: the AI provider you configured (optional), the GLEIF LEI lookup
(`api.gleif.org`) in the DORA register, a vendor logo URL you enter, and the
check of document URLs found by the AI document collection. As a consequence,
the security boundary is your browser and the machine hosting the files — the
project itself never sees your data.

## Supported versions

Only the tip of the `main` branch is supported. Fixes are shipped by publishing
a new commit; there are no long-lived maintenance branches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **confidentially**, not through a public issue:

- GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability" tab of this repository), or
- email **security@cisotoolbox.org**

Include a description, affected file(s), reproduction steps and, if possible, a
proof of concept. Please allow up to **10 working days** for a first response
and up to **90 days** before public disclosure.

Out of scope (and already known / accepted by design):

- Data readable from `localStorage` by anyone with access to the
  same browser profile — this is the storage model, documented above.
- Missing authentication: there is none, by design.
- Findings that require the user to paste hostile content into their own
  assessment and then open it themselves.
- Reports produced by an automated scanner without a working proof of concept.

## What we do care about

- Cross-site scripting through imported data (`demo-*.json`, saved analyses,
  CSV / Excel imports) — all rendering must go through the `esc()` helper.
- Weaknesses in the AES-256-GCM / PBKDF2 encryption path: key derivation and
  encryption in `js/cisotoolbox.js`, used for saved files and snapshots
  (`js/cisotoolbox_local.js`) and for the Vendor Portal links and exports
  (`js/TPRM_app.js`, `portal/js/VendorPortal_app.js`).
- Leakage of an AI provider API key entered in the settings panel (the key is
  kept in `localStorage` and sent only to the provider endpoint you chose).
- Content-Security-Policy bypasses (the app is written to run with
  `script-src 'self'`, no inline handlers).

## Secrets and personal data

Never attach a real assessment, a real audit or a real vendor register to an
issue or a pull request — they contain client data. To reproduce an issue, use
the fictional demo dataset shipped with the app (`demo-fr.json` /
`demo-en.json`, MedSecure), loadable from the settings panel, or build a small
fictional example from the application.
