# Contributing to Vendor (TPRM)

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This repository is one module of the
[CISO Toolbox](https://www.cisotoolbox.org) suite. It is a **frontend-only** application: vanilla
JavaScript, no framework, no bundler, no `node_modules` needed to run it.

## Running it

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd vendor
python3 -m http.server 8080     # any static server works
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Opening `index.html` straight from the filesystem (`file://`) mostly works, but
`fetch()`-based features (loading `demo-*.json`, lazy-loaded frameworks) are
blocked by the browser's origin rules. Use a static server.

## Replicated files

> **Read this before editing anything under `js/`, `css/` or `ts/types/`.**

Part of this repository is **replicated from a private shared repository** —
the design system and the cross-module libraries that all CISO Toolbox modules
have in common. Those files carry this banner:

```
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// REPLICATED from the private shared repository — do not edit here.
// GENERATED from shared/ts/ (or shared/types/) by shared/ts-build.sh.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

They are produced by `shared/ts-build.sh` from TypeScript sources that live
outside this repository, and are copied into every module. **A pull request
that modifies one of them cannot be merged**: the next synchronisation would
silently overwrite your change, and the same change would be missing from the
other modules.

The authoritative list is in [`.replicated-files`](.replicated-files). It
currently covers:

- `js/cisotoolbox.js`, `js/cisotoolbox_local.js`, `js/i18n.js`,
  `js/ai_common.js`, `js/referentiels_catalog.js`
- the shared widgets `js/ct_*.js` (`ct_table`, `ct_modal`, `ct_bulkbar`,
  `ct_refselect`, `ct_settings`, `ct_measure_modal`, `ct_userpicker`, …)
- the design-system stylesheet `css/cisotoolbox.css`
- every declaration file under `ts/types/`

If you found a real bug in one of them, **open an issue** describing it (with a
reproduction) instead of a pull request. The fix will be made upstream and will
reach this repository — and all the other modules — on the next sync.

Everything else *is* yours to change: `index.html`, the module stylesheet
(`css/tprm.css`), the `js/`-prefixed module files, `ts/` module sources,
`demo-*.json`, the docs and the `e2e/` tests.

## TypeScript sources

`ts/` holds the TypeScript sources for the module-specific code; `js/` holds the
compiled output that the browser actually loads. Both are committed, because the
app must run with no build step. If you change a `.ts` file, regenerate the
matching `.js` (`tsc -p .`) and commit both, keeping them consistent.

## Coding conventions

- Vanilla ES5-compatible JavaScript, no framework, no external runtime
  dependency (the few bundled libraries under `js/vendor/` are third-party and
  are not modified here).
- **No inline event handlers.** The app is written to run under
  `script-src 'self'`; wire events with `data-click` / `data-change` /
  `data-input` attributes handled by the shared delegation layer.
- **Always escape** anything that comes from user or imported data with the
  shared `esc()` helper before injecting it into HTML.
- Every user-visible string goes through the i18n layer (`data-i18n` attribute
  or `t("key")`), with an entry in both `*_i18n_fr.js` and `*_i18n_en.js`.
- Keep it accessible: real `<button>` elements, `aria-label` on icon-only
  controls, visible focus.

## Tests

End-to-end tests live in [`e2e/`](e2e/) and use Playwright against a local
static server. See [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md) for how to run them. Any
behaviour change should come with, or update, a test.

## Demo data

The repository currently ships **no demo dataset** — the previous
`demo-*.json` files were removed and new ones will be generated later. Until
then, build the data you need from the application itself.

When demo datasets come back, they must describe a **fictional** company.
Never add real organisation data — no real company, person, email address or
site. Pull requests containing real assessment data will be closed.

## Pull requests

1. One concern per pull request.
2. Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`,
   `test:`, `chore:`).
3. Run the e2e suite before pushing.
4. Do not commit build artefacts, deployment scripts, `.htaccess`, or anything
   matching `.gitignore`.
